But does mixing our styles and logic run counter to the original ideas of CSS? Does it break progressive enhancement? In this talk, we’ll take an empathetic look at these new approaches, how they relate to the history of CSS, and why they might possibly hold the key to the future of CSS—all from the point-of-view of someone who has been writing CSS since 1999.\x22,\x22speaker\x22:\x22Mark Dalgleish\x22,\x22twitter\x22:\x22markdalgleish\x22,\x22video\x22:null,\x22tags\x22:[\x22css\x22,\x22css-in-js\x22],\x22layout\x22:\x22talk\x22,\x22weight\x22:2,\x22srcFilePath\x22:\x22src\/pages\/confs\/2017_cssconf_eu\/a_unified_styling_language.md\x22,\x22id\x22:\x22a_unified_styling_language\x22,\x22url\x22:\x22\/confs\/2017_cssconf_eu\/a_unified_styling_language.html\x22},\x22css_and_the_first_meaningful_paint\x22:{\x22title\x22:\x22CSS and the first meaningful paint\x22,\x22description\x22:\x22To render a webpage browsers needs to go through the complex dance of networking, parsing and painting before any content can be displayed to your user. Over the years, we\x27ve developed mechanisms and hacks to aid the browser at each stage of this process, but these have always come at some cost or trade-off.\\nHow can we utilize modern web platform features to load our CSS as fast as possible? Should we still be inlining our critical content into the document or instead, how can HTTP\/2 server push and Service Workers help us?\\nIn this talk we will take a journey exploring the current, past, and future best-practices for loading CSS in the browser and how we can achieve a first meaningful paint within 1000ms. Ultimately creating a faster, more resilient experience for our users.\x22,\x22speaker\x22:\x22Patrick Hamann\x22,\x22twitter\x22:\x22patrickhamann\x22,\x22video\x22:null,\x22tags\x22:[\x22css\x22,\x22performance\x22],\x22layout\x22:\x22talk\x22,\x22weight\x22:2,\x22srcFilePath\x22:\x22src\/pages\/confs\/2017_cssconf_eu\/css_and_the_first_meaningful_paint.md\x22,\x22id\x22:\x22css_and_the_first_meaningful_paint\x22,\x22url\x22:\x22\/confs\/2017_cssconf_eu\/css_and_the_first_meaningful_paint.html\x22},\x22css_and_the_hierarchy_problem\x22:{\x22title\x22:\x22CSS and the hierarchy problem: What makes a CSS developer?\x22,\x22description\x22:\x22This talk is about hierarchies: as CSS hurtles toward being object- and systems-oriented, the titles and responsibilities of designer and developer become much more fluid and yet, we continue to categorise. We draw lines between front and back end, between CSS and Javascript (“CSS isn’t _real_ development”), and even between CSS disciplines, but why? Furthermore, we implicitly draw these lines between white male developers and everyone else. This results in damaging hierarchies that threaten to devalue the work we do in diversifying CSS — both as a language and as a community.\x22,\x22speaker\x22:\x22Ivana McConnell\x22,\x22twitter\x22:\x22ivanamcconnell\x22,\x22video\x22:null,\x22tags\x22:[\x22css\x22,\x22community\x22],\x22layout\x22:\x22talk\x22,\x22weight\x22:2,\x22srcFilePath\x22:\x22src\/pages\/confs\/2017_cssconf_eu\/css_and_the_hierarchy_problem.md\x22,\x22id\x22:\x22css_and_the_hierarchy_problem\x22,\x22url\x22:\x22\/confs\/2017_cssconf_eu\/css_and_the_hierarchy_problem.html\x22},\x22css_art_history_101\x22:{\x22title\x22:\x22CSS Art History 101: Decoding Layout Through The Ages\x22,\x22description\x22:\x22For centuries the visual arts have been used to tell stories, warn people about dangers and invoke emotion. Today we use the internet for all those purposes and more. Just as the Vatican employed painters to spread their message – it will be the developers and designers who will lead us into the next Renaissance. But there is still a lot to learn from the great masters. In this talk, we will flexbox the Golden Ratio with Leonardo DaVinci, up the pixel ratio for our devices with the Impressionists \x26 ”inspect elements” of some iconic works of art to make the web a more beautiful place.\x22,\x22speaker\x22:\x22Patricia Realini\x22,\x22twitter\x22:\x22patriciarealini\x22,\x22video\x22:null,\x22tags\x22:[\x22css\x22,\x22inspiration\x22],\x22layout\x22:\x22talk\x22,\x22weight\x22:2,\x22srcFilePath\x22:\x22src\/pages\/confs\/2017_cssconf_eu\/css_art_history_101.md\x22,\x22id\x22:\x22css_art_history_101\x22,\x22url\x22:\x22\/confs\/2017_cssconf_eu\/css_art_history_101.html\x22},\x22data_sketches_a_visualization_a_month\x22:{\x22title\x22:\x22Data sketch|es: A Visualization a Month\x22,\x22description\x22:\x22Data sketches is a collaboration between Nadieh and Shirley, where they choose a topic and visualize it by the end of the month. The collaboration started for many reasons: they weren’t creating as many personal data visualization projects, so they were looking for the motivation to make more. They wanted to explore their creativity, to experiment with the tools that are out there, to learn from each other, and to have fun.\\nIn this talk, Shirley and Nadieh will share the lessons they learned while working on data sketches. They will highlight their favorite months of data, sketches, and code: what made them their favorites, the mistakes made along the way, and how they overcame them. They hope that by sharing their visualizations’ humble, ugly duckling beginnings and their many (embarrassing) iterations, that it will inspire others to create their own unique and compelling visualizations.\x22,\x22speaker\x22:\x22Nadieh Bremer \x26 Shirley Wu\x22,\x22twitter\x22:\x22sxywu\x22,\x22video\x22:null,\x22tags\x22:[\x22css\x22,\x22data-visualization\x22],\x22layout\x22:\x22talk\x22,\x22weight\x22:2,\x22srcFilePath\x22:\x22src\/pages\/confs\/2017_cssconf_eu\/data_sketches_a_visualization_a_month.md\x22,\x22id\x22:\x22data_sketches_a_visualization_a_month\x22,\x22url\x22:\x22\/confs\/2017_cssconf_eu\/data_sketches_a_visualization_a_month.html\x22},\x22get_ready_for_the_future_of_css\x22:{\x22title\x22:\x22Get Ready for the Future of CSS!\x22,\x22description\x22:\x22It’s time to start thinking about new and upcoming CSS features that will boost your workflow and give you more power and flexibility when building your projects.

We\x27ll go through how we use Grandstand, a CSS framework built by BBC Sport, as the scaffolding for our CSS.

Because UIs fundamentally are not documents, we\x27ve seen a mindset shift towards building component-based system.\\nThe rise of JavaScript frameworks like React, Ember and recently Angular 2, the effort of the W3C to standardize a web-native component system, pattern libraries and styleguides being considered \x27the right way to build web applications\x27 and many other things have illuminated this revolution – we are now in the \x27Component Age\x27.\\nWith that and a few more things in mind, Max along with Glen Maddern (co-creator of css-modules) sat down and started thinking about styling in this new era.

It gives you a way of understanding why things are weird, which is a good starting point to avoiding or fixing weirdness. It can give you an early heads up as to what might be happening in the very near future. It also opens up an opportunity to be part of the process, to contribute to CSS - just like any open source project.
