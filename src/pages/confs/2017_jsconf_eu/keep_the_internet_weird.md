title: "Keep the Internet Weird"
description: "The early 2000s bred a new generation of web developers and designers out of the pure need of creative expression. Teens didn’t have access to StackOverflow, and couldn’t easily Google their coding problems—so they turned to each other. Through collaboration and inspiration from others that were blazing their own way, they created their own unique personal sites without any regard for standards. Let’s explore the world of CSS via ‘filter: dropshadow’, JavaScript snippets, 8 pixel fonts and take a look back at what the web looked like before we followed the rules."
