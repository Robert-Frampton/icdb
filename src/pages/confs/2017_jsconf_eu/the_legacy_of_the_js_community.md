##### Notes

> Small actions have big impact  

The actions that we take right now can have months to take full effect. What can we do to push the community and how do we want it to look in he future?

> Our community needs leaders  

**Legacy**
- It's usually perceived as a negative, old, buggy thing in the software world
- A body of persons sent on a mission (original description)

**Purpose & People**
- JS is the people and the community that support and use the language and not the language itself

> People first. Always  

A lot of people tend to look down on us as less than a developer.

> Our heritage is a belief in the power of the web. We must create the culture we hope to carry forth  

Everybody is enough, everybody belongs

Small actions can create huge an unpredictable impact.
