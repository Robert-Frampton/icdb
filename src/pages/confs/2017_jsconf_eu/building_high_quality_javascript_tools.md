##### Notes

We need to keep investing into developer experience

**Look at tools with a product mind**
- Performance
- Features
- Adoptability

**In the process**
- Fix
- Rewrites
- Polish

**Performance**
- Apply 1% improvements incrementally

**Features**
- Improved output
	- The real value is when a test is failing
- Immersive Watch Mode
- Snapshot assertion
	- Preventing a lot of issues fast
	- They don't replace other assertions
- Multiproject Runner
- The experience should be delightful

**Adoptability**
- Minimal configuration
- OOTB test setup in react-native and react-native-app
- Create tooling (yarn create)
- Translations

**Modularity**
- Packages help with separation of concerns and helps turn something into a platform
- Consolidate infrastructure
- Share best practices

If you improve experience, developers use it more. 35% increase in number of tests in fb since adoption.
