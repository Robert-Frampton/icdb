title: "Dynamic video in the browser"
description: "Rather than just playing videos in the browser; what if you could edit and composite them on the fly? Just as the Web Audio API allowed for dynamic audio manipulation, we can now do similar things for video, opening up the creative possibilities for interactive visual experiences on the web. In this talk I’ll show you how, with some live coded demos using an open source library. I’ll also talk about how the BBC is using these techniques to explore the future of TV."
