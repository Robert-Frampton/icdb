title: "Getting Reactive with CSS"
description: "As user interfaces evolve and become more interactive, design requirements become more complex. By combining CSS variables with reactive programming in JS, we can now express animations, styles, layout, and more in ways never before possible with CSS. In this talk, weâ€™ll explore what functional reactive programming is, why it is incredibly useful, and how we can leverage the power of CSS variables to push the limits of styling the web."

##### Notes
- CSS is not powerful but that's a good thing  
- You should use the language with least power to accomplish what you want
- Because lines between webapps and native apps are blurring, microinteractions are crucial to reduce cognitive load.

###### Making web interactions easier to make with CSS

**CSS Variables**
- Performance setting a css variable on a parent element is twice as fast as inline styles
- Support in all major browsers

**Functional & Reactive**
- Observables Spec (rxjs)
- Marble diagrams

##### Opinion

Interesting stress on moving styling back to CSS and just sending variables over from JS or any other language.
